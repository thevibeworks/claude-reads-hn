*** TLDR
Developer spends way too much time perfecting a wood finish recipe: 50g tung oil, carnauba wax, beeswax, lanolin, damar resin, coconut oil, metallic drier, vitamin E. Cures in 48 hours, hydrophobic, food-safe. The kind of obsessive experimentation that makes HN great.

*** Take
This is peak "I could just buy mineral oil but where's the fun in that" energy. Also the most wholesome thing on HN today, which says something.

*** TLDR
Neal Stephenson's legendary essay comparing operating systems to car dealerships. Windows is a station wagon, Mac is a European sedan, Linux is a free tank. Argues GUIs create metaphor layers that distance users from actual computing while making it accessible to Eloi consumers.

*** Take
26 years later and the tank is still free but now it has RGB lighting and a package manager that sometimes works. The station wagon has become a subscription service that shows you ads.

** SoundCloud just banned VPN access :privacy:vpn:streaming:drm:

*** TLDR
SoundCloud started blocking VPN users, breaking access for paying subscribers. Part of a broader trend with HBO Max doing the same. Users are understandably furious since VPNs have legitimate privacy and security uses.

*** Take
Nothing says "we value our paying customers" like treating them all as potential pirates. This is the streaming industry's favorite self-own.

** The Typeframe PX-88 Portable Computing System :hardware:diy:raspberrypi:cyberdeck:

*** TLDR
A DIY cyberdeck built around a Raspberry Pi 4 with mechanical keyboard and modular design. "Is it a cyberdeck or a writerdeck? It's whatever you need it to be." Minimal soldering required, designed for people who want to build their own serious portable computer.

*** Take
Beautiful device that will absolutely end up in a drawer after two weeks because your laptop can do everything better. But those two weeks will feel magical.

** CapROS: Capability-Based Reliable Operating System :os:security:capabilities:lowlevel:

:END:

*** TLDR
An OS that uses capability-based security and orthogonal persistence, descended from EROS and KeyKOS. The project combines 80s ideas about capabilities with modern performance concerns. Sadly appears dormant since 2022.

*** Take
Intel tried this in 1989 with iAPX 432 and it flopped spectacularly. But the ideas keep coming back because everyone secretly knows flat memory models are held together with duct tape and optimism.
