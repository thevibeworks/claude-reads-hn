> Trees dying after one bloom, open source licenses dying after one acquisition, and 759 developers still answering "what are you working on"

**Highlights**
- Adafruit: Arduino's cloud terms may kill the open source promise
- NVIDIA turns gaming GPUs into protein-folding supercomputers
- Rio's talipot palms bloom once, then die (nature's ultimate YOLO)
- Arborium: tree-sitter highlighting that actually parses your code
- Ask HN explodes with 759 side projects and counting

### [Adafruit: Arduino's Rules Are 'Incompatible With Open Source'](https://thenewstack.io/adafruit-arduinos-rules-are-incompatible-with-open-source/) • 110pts 40c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46265362)
TLDR: Adafruit founder Limor Fried argues Arduino's new Terms and Conditions violate open source principles by restricting reverse engineering of cloud tools and adding field-of-use restrictions. The core issue: you can't call something open source if you add usage restrictions like "no military purposes" - that defeats the entire point.
Take: Every hardware company eventually discovers the cloud lock-in playbook. Arduino's defense that "restrictions only apply to cloud services" is like saying the handcuffs only apply to your wrists.
Comments:
- "Anything that was open, stays open. Now contemplate open Android and Google Play Services" -Animats
- "Considering the EFF and Arduino positions in favour, I can't be bothered that Adafruit is trying to drum up marketing content" -arjie
- "They do not even own the CPU or bootloader. Qualcomm can't pressure these rules to market" -Surac

### [Why Proteins Fold and How GPUs Help Us Fold](https://aval.bearblog.dev/nvidiaproteins/) • 20pts 2c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270972)
TLDR: A deep dive into why protein folding was biology's hardest problem for 50 years and how DeepMind's AlphaFold essentially solved it in 2020. NVIDIA leveraged their gaming GPU architecture for parallel processing in biological research, making protein structure prediction 138x faster with tools like BioNeMo.
Take: The same hardware that lets teenagers rage-quit Fortnite now enables drug discovery. We went from "gaming GPUs go brrr" to "actually reading the language of life." Progress is weird.
Comments:
- "Did AlphaFold not use TPUs?" -VirusNewbie
- "Was this text AI-generated?" -atomlib

### [Rio de Janeiro's Talipot Palm Trees Bloom for the First and Only Time](https://en.jardineriaon.com/The-talipot-palm-trees-of-Rio-de-Janeiro-bloom-for-the-first-and-only-time.html) • 125pts 32c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46178966)
TLDR: The talipot palm only blooms once between ages 40-80, producing a massive floral plume with millions of tiny flowers, then dies. Landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx planted them in Flamengo Park in the 1960s, and now they're all flowering simultaneously - a once-in-a-lifetime botanical event.
Take: Imagine waiting 60 years to do one thing perfectly, then dying immediately after. These trees have better life priorities than most startups.
Comments:
- "I lived in Flamengo for years and passed these trees often, never knew this about them. The diversity of palms there is incredible" -iterateoften
- "The matter deserving one sentence is expanded to hundreds with dozens of ads. Slop of some kind" -zkmon
- "Better link: AP News article" -holografix

### [Arborium: Tree-sitter Code Highlighting with Native and WASM Targets](https://arborium.bearcove.eu/) • 51pts 10c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46270298)
TLDR: A syntax highlighting library built on tree-sitter supporting 96 languages with actual code parsing (not regex). Outputs HTML or ANSI terminal colors, works natively or in WebAssembly, and gracefully recovers from syntax errors. Created by fasterthanlime, who has notable open source sponsorship.
Take: Finally, syntax highlighting that understands your code instead of pattern-matching its way through like a drunk regex. The name is a Latin pun about "where tree-sitter grammars live." Peak developer humor.
Comments:
- "I'm building an online 3D editor and the ease of highlighting static text via Arborium seems nice" -mg
- "The sponsorships achieved by the author is admirable - they really make a lot of valuable OSS" -jasonjmcghee
- "Better link is the author's article about this rather than the artifact produced" -joshka

### [Ask HN: What Are You Working On? (December 2025)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264491) • 236pts 759c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264491)
TLDR: [REVISIT - now with 759 comments] The monthly ritual where developers share their side projects. Highlights include Pagecord (indie blogging platform, $29/yr), BobaLearn (graded Chinese stories for language learning), and MyTinyCafe (a PWA so one dev can play barista for his family).
Take: 759 comments of "I'm building X" and most will be abandoned by February. But the MyTinyCafe guy who made an app to take coffee orders from his wife and daughter? That's the kind of overengineering that makes this industry beautiful.
Comments:
- "Pagecord - an independent blogging builder. Simple and makes you want to write more. Free forever or $29/yr" -lylo
- "BobaLearn - read and generate graded Chinese stories. Why pay for books when I can make it free?" -johntiger1
- "MyTinyCafe - a PWA for my wife and daughter to order coffee at home. I'm the barista" -krlx
