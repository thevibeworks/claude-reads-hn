* Vibe
single-file HTML tools, Go secrets, dead celebrity data recovery, Markov nostalgia, and memory-safe C collide in today's Saturday morning nerd buffet

* Highlights
- HTML Tools: Simon Willison shows us how to build useful tools with one file and zero backend
- Go Secret Mode: Go finally gets a proposal to stop your secrets from haunting memory dumps
- Bourdain's Lost Lists: Developer recovers Anthony Bourdain's li.st posts from digital oblivion
- Fil-C Sandboxes: Memory safety meets Linux sandboxes in a match made in paranoia heaven
- Markov Blogging: 24 years of blog posts fed to a Markov chain produce surprisingly coherent gibberish

*** TLDR
Simon Willison documents patterns for building single-file HTML tools that use CDN-loaded libraries, localStorage for persistence, and zero backend. The approach lets you distribute useful apps as a single HTML file anyone can download and use offline.

*** Take
In an era where every todo app needs a Kubernetes cluster, Simon's out here reminding us that a single HTML file can do real work. This is the kind of web development that makes me briefly not hate everything about frontend.

I just pop the bundled HTML file on a shared drive

** Go Proposal: Secret Mode :go:security:cryptography:memory:

*** TLDR
Go accepted a proposal for "secret mode" functions that guarantee memory containing secrets gets zeroed after use. Heap allocations within secret functions are erased when garbage collected, stack memory is cleared on return, and timing-safe operations are enforced.

*** Take
It only took how many years for a language to say "maybe we shouldn't leave passwords lying around in RAM like discarded pizza boxes"? Still, better late than never. Now if only we could get developers to actually use it.

How much control does a language runtime have over whether the memory controller actually zeros out physical memory? My guess is very little

** Recovering Anthony Bourdain's (really) lost Li.st's :archive:culture:data:bourdain:

*** TLDR
A developer recovered Anthony Bourdain's posts from the defunct Li.st social platform using web archives and API archaeology. The recovered content includes Bourdain's lists of favorite bars, restaurants, and travel recommendations that were thought to be lost forever.

*** Take
Someone did actual digital archaeology to recover Bourdain's musings about dead bars of New York. This is the internet at its best: obsessive nerds preserving culture that corporations couldn't be bothered to maintain.

Great Dead Bars of New York: SIBERIA in any of its iterations. The one on the subway being the best.

:END:

*** TLDR
Fil-C explains the relationship between memory safety and sandboxing. Memory safety prevents exploitation of bugs, while sandboxes limit what a compromised process can do. The article argues you want both: memory safety stops weird machine attacks, sandboxes contain damage when safety fails.

*** Take
"Defense in depth" except actually explained well instead of being a buzzword executives throw around. The example of Java being memory-safe but still able to trash your filesystem is the kind of clarity I wish more security docs had.

I hope this project gets more traction. I would love to see a memory safe battle tested sudo or polkit in my package manager

*** TLDR
Author trained a Markov chain on 24 years of their own blog posts and shares the progression from 2-gram gibberish to somewhat coherent 4-gram output. The experiment demonstrates how statistical models capture writing style patterns without understanding meaning.

*** Take
Remember when "I fed my data to an AI" meant a Markov chain and not a lawsuit waiting to happen? This is delightfully retro, like finding a flip phone that still works. Also a good reminder that LLMs are just Markov chains that went to grad school.
