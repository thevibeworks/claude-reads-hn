> GPT-5.2 drops while hackers debate whether AI knows anything at all

**Highlights**
- GPT-5.2: The new hotness that still can't identify a RAM slot
- Nokia N900 Necromancy: Supercapacitors and USB-C bring a Linux phone back from the dead
- CRISPR Fungus Meat: Gene-edited mycoprotein uses 44% less sugar, tastes like regret-free chicken
- Bear Blog De-indexed: Google ghosted a blogger and nobody knows why
- 4 Billion If Statements: The most unhinged way to check if a number is even

### [GPT-5.2](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/) • 1096pts 963c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234788)
TLDR: OpenAI released GPT-5.2 with improved reasoning benchmarks and some vision capabilities. The model shows gains on standard tests but the promotional motherboard image hilariously mislabels RAM and PCIe slots.
Take: A thousand comments and the spiciest debate is whether AI "knows" anything. The answer is no, but neither do most people on HN, so we're even.
Comment: "LLMs always hallucinate, but we sometimes get lucky when the hallucinations match up with reality" -commenter

### [Nokia N900 Necromancy](https://yaky.dev/2025-12-11-nokia-n900-necromancy/) • 395pts 152c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239177)
TLDR: Author resurrected a Nokia N900 by building a fake battery from supercapacitors, swapping micro-USB for USB-C, and 3D-printing custom housing. Now works as an internet radio running Open Media Player.
Take: This is what peak "I will not let my hardware die" energy looks like. The N900 was the last phone that respected you, and this person gave it CPR with capacitors.
Comment: "I installed a BitTorrent client, found the release on Pirate Bay, successfully torrented just the subtitle file, and used an editor to read the subtitles" -sollewitt, casually describing 2009 as the peak of mobile computing

### [CRISPR Fungus: Protein-packed, sustainable, and tastes like meat](https://www.isaaa.org/kc/cropbiotechupdate/article/default.asp?ID=21607) • 232pts 153c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239629)
TLDR: Researchers CRISPR'd Fusarium venenatum (the Quorn fungus) to knock out two genes, making it 88% faster at producing protein while using 44% less sugar. Claims 60% fewer emissions and 70% less land than chicken.
Take: We're editing fungi to make better fake meat while the tech industry builds chatbots that can't identify RAM. Humanity's priorities are a beautiful mess.
Comment: "The production process of gene-edited MP is more environmentally friendly than chicken meat and cell-cultured meat" -SapporoChris, summarizing why your grandchildren might grow up thinking "chicken" is a flavor not an animal

### [Google de-indexed Bear Blog and I don't know why](https://journal.james-zhan.com/google-de-indexed-my-entire-bear-blog-and-i-dont-know-why/) • 290pts 119c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239752)
TLDR: Author's Bear Blog vanished from Google after one month for no apparent reason. Still indexed on DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Brave. Despite extensive debugging with Bear Blog's founder, the cause remains unknown. Solution: new subdomain and hope.
Take: Google's search algorithm is now an eldritch horror that punishes blogs at random. The SEO game has evolved from "optimize your content" to "pray to the algorithm gods and sacrifice a canonical tag."
Comment: "Traffic to my blog plummeted this year and you can never be entirely sure how it happened" -firefoxd, speaking for every indie blogger watching their graphs flatline

### [4 billion if statements (2023)](https://andreasjhkarlsson.github.io//jekyll/update/2023/12/27/4-billion-if-statements.html) • 298pts 91c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46174114)
TLDR: Author saw a TikTok of someone checking even/odd with if statements, then took the joke to its logical extreme: generating 4 billion if statements to check all 32-bit integers. Created a 40GB binary using x86-64 assembly opcodes when compilers gave up.
Take: This is the content I live for. Someone looked at modulo and said "no, we're doing this the hard way" and then actually did it. Peak chaotic neutral programming.
Comment: "I went from thousands of indexed pages to about 100" -donatj (wrong thread but the existential dread energy fits)
