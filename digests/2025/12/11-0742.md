## Editor's Picks

### 1. Size of Life
Link: https://neal.fun/size-of-life/
Why it matters: Interactive scale visualization that takes you from the smallest particles to the largest structures in the universe. Classic Neal.fun execution with dynamic soundscape that evolves as you zoom.
Best comment: "The dynamic soundscape is delightful, as it subtly adds instruments and musical texture as you progress." - chrismorgan
Hot take: Neal consistently makes the internet slightly more wonderful, which is honestly more valuable than most startups burning billions.

### 2. Australia Enforces Teen Social Media Ban  
Link: https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/australia-social-media-ban-takes-effect-world-first-2025-12-09/
Why it matters: Australia just implemented the world's first social media ban for under-16s. Platforms face $50M fines. The technical implementation details are... sparse.
Best comment: "It doesn't have to be watertight to work. Social media is all about network effects. Once most kids are on there, everyone has to be on there." - zmmmmh
Hot take: Australia speedrunning the "think of the children" playbook while tech companies frantically Google "age verification without dystopia."

### 3. Gemini API Key Frustration
Link: https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/
Why it matters: Developer documents the kafkaesque nightmare of trying to get a simple API key from Google's fractured service ecosystem. Three different APIs, multiple quota systems, silent failures.
Best comment: "Unfortunately Google's problem is the product is dictated by the architecture of the APIs" - asim
Hot take: Google's API experience makes AWS console look like peak UX design. That's not a compliment to either.

### 4. Auto-Grading HN With Hindsight
Link: https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/auto-grade-hn/
Why it matters: Karpathy used AI to grade decade-old HN predictions against reality. Turns out the crowd was surprisingly accurate, especially on Swift and Figma.
Best comment: "I would install a Chrome extension that shows a score by every username on this site grading how well their expressed opinions match what subsequently happened" - modeless
Hot take: Finally, a way to objectively prove that guy who said "React is a fad" was wrong. Peak internet vindication.

### 5. Patterns.dev
Link: https://www.patterns.dev/
Why it matters: Comprehensive resource for modern web development patterns, covering React, performance, rendering, and design patterns with interactive examples.
Best comment: "I find that the more senior you become, the less you rely on software design patterns" - socketcluster
Hot take: Design patterns: the programming equivalent of learning Latin. Mostly useless until suddenly essential.

## Worth Reading
- Booting Linux in QEMU with Go PID 1 - Deep dive into kernel fundamentals
- CSS Design Mistakes - Official list from the CSS working group
- 12 Million Years of Giant Anacondas - Snakes have been consistently terrifying

## Skip
- Anaconda fossils - Unless you're into paleoherpetology
- CSS mistakes - If you're already dead inside from web development

## TL;DR
Australia bans teens from social media while Google makes getting API keys harder than the actual development. Meanwhile, Neal makes beautiful things and Karpathy proves HN commenters aren't completely wrong about everything.
