** Apple has locked my Apple ID, and I have no recourse :apple:security:customer:corporate:

*** TLDR
Dr. Paris Buttfield-Addison, author of 20+ O'Reilly books on Apple development and co-runner of the longest-running independent Apple developer conference, got his Apple ID permanently disabled after trying to redeem a $500 gift card from a major retailer. Over $30,000 in Apple hardware now can't access iCloud, iMessage, or his photos. Apple support has been useless.

*** Take
Nothing says "valued customer" like having decades of loyalty and developer evangelism count for exactly zero when a fraud detection algorithm gets a false positive. The gift card lockout trigger is particularly absurd since Apple literally sells these things.

I am not a casual user. I have literally written the book on Apple development... I have effectively been an evangelist for this company's products and services

*** TLDR
Albert Cornelissen designed the MRF2, an open-source medium-format camera using 3D-printed parts, Mamiya Press lenses, custom PCBs, and LiDAR-based focusing. It supports multiple film formats from 35mm panoramas to 6x9 and includes a light meter with horizon level indicator. All build files are on GitHub.

*** Take
While everyone's arguing about whether film photography is dead, this absolute madlad just casually open-sourced a camera system that would cost thousands to buy commercially. The "mostly plug and play, with minimal soldering" claim is doing some heavy lifting though.

This is a viewfinder camera with scale focus. Rangefinders have a complex mechanism to measure distance which would be beyond the scope of this project

*** TLDR
Deep dive into how financial exchanges transform concurrent order events into a deterministic timeline using sequencers that assign monotonic sequence numbers. The architecture uses event sourcing where the in-memory order book is just a "projection" of an append-only log, enabling perfect reconstruction and auditing.

*** Take
The fact that global finance runs on "every event must pass through the same chokepoint" is both elegant and terrifying. One sequencer to rule them all, one sequencer to bind them.

This is just hilarious at a meta level... no real world allocation of resources is improved by having to game transactions to this level of time granularity. This is just rent-seeking disguised as a useful service

*** TLDR
Abelian Sandpiles are grids where cells accumulate "sand" and topple when they hit 4 grains, distributing to neighbors. The order of toppling doesn't matter (hence "Abelian"), and the resulting patterns are mesmerizingly geometric and fractal-like. The blog includes interactive widgets to play with the concept.

*** Take
Finally, a mathematical concept that delivers exactly what it promises: beauty from simplicity. Unlike most CS abstractions named after physical things, this one actually involves imaginary sand doing satisfying cascades.

I implemented this in Rust some years back. It is connected to some serious research mathematics

*** TLDR
The legendary actor and comedian turned 100 today, and HN is celebrating his lesser-known passion for computer animation on the Amiga. There's a 2004 video of him demonstrating his hobby. He's been an active tech enthusiast for decades.

*** Take
A man who survived vaudeville, black-and-white TV, color TV, VHS, DVD, streaming, and still stayed curious enough to mess around with Amiga graphics software deserves every birthday candle. Also, dolphins once rescued him from drowning at age 84. This man is operating on a different timeline than the rest of us.

In my 30's, I exercised to look good. In my 50's, to stay fit. In my 70's, to stay ambulatory. In my 80's, to avoid assisted living. Now in my 90's, I'm just doing it out of pure defiance
