* Vibe
HDMI cables misbehave, jets almost collide, and everyone wants to self-host until they see the price tag

* Highlights
- HDMI-CEC: A Pi and $7 cable fix the mess Samsung and Denon couldn't
- Umbrel: Self-hosting for $499, or as the comments call it, "Apple pricing for Linux"
- JetBlue: Almost hit an Air Force jet because someone turned off the transponder
- Chafa: Finally, terminal graphics that don't look like 1993
- Cosmic rays: Turns out nearby supernovas helped build Earth, no big deal

* Stories

** Fix HDMI-CEC weirdness with a Raspberry Pi and a $7 cable :homeautomation:raspberrypi:hdmi:diy:

*** TLDR
Author uses a Raspberry Pi as a "CEC shepherd" to fix audio routing issues between his Samsung TV and Denon receiver. The Pi monitors the HDMI-CEC bus, watches for console activity, and automatically sends commands to wake the receiver when the TV and consoles fail to communicate properly. Classic case of solving a problem manufacturers should have fixed.

*** Take
We've reached peak home automation when debugging your living room requires wireshark-level packet analysis of your HDMI bus. The consoles "missed the last week of CEC school" is charitable; they never enrolled.

Modern AV stuff is insane. I have no interest in taking it up as a hobby... Luckily, I have one of the last remaining TVs with a headphone jack

HDMI-CEC apparently can only support like 3 console-like devices. I have an Apple TV, Nintendo Switch 2, Sound Bar and PS5 hooked up, but only 3 can really interact

I used a similar setup to translate CEC user commands... the pi had a shell script that reads all the loglines coming from cec-client

*** TLDR
Umbrel is a self-hosted home cloud OS that lets you run Bitcoin nodes, Plex, Nextcloud, and AI models locally. Comes as a plug-and-play device starting at $499 with up to 4TB SSD. One-click app store for self-hosting various services, emphasizing data ownership and privacy.

*** Take
The eternal tension of self-hosting: everyone wants to "own their data" until they realize owning data means owning servers, updates, backups, and the anxiety that comes with being your own IT department. At $499, Umbrel is betting you'll pay Apple money for the privilege of doing Apple's job yourself.

I am uninterested in purchasing proprietary hardware running a proprietary operating system... you can't extend it without their proprietary app store

A decade of personal cloud box attempts has shown the hard part isn't the hardware, it's the long-term social contract... once the company pivots or dies, you're left with a sealed brick

I like Umbrel's technical approach: Its apps are just docker compose files with a little extra... I did not like the reliability around app installations

*** TLDR
［From title + comments, article behind paywall］ A JetBlue flight nearly collided with a US Air Force jet, reportedly because the military aircraft had its transponder turned off. After this near miss, there was another incident the following day involving a business jet. Dutch airspace appears to have been involved.

*** Take
Military operations require secrecy, sure, but there's a difference between operational security and "let's turn off the thing that stops us from hitting civilian aircraft full of people." The fact that AWACS can track civilian traffic but apparently nobody thought to, you know, coordinate, is impressive in the worst way.

Why was the Air Force plane's transponder turned off? This is negligence that almost killed a plane full of people and endangered a national security operation

The US could issue a notice of an Alert Area where military operations are in progress AND could coordinate with Dutch airspace authorities

*** TLDR
Chafa is a terminal graphics tool that renders images and GIFs using Sixels, Kitty, iTerm2 protocols, or Unicode mosaics. Supports truecolor, 256-color, and 16-color modes with alpha transparency. SIMD optimized and multithreaded for speed. Works with CJK fullwidth characters for better visual fidelity.

*** Take
In 2025 we're still impressed when terminals can display pictures without looking like a corrupted fax. Chafa is genuinely good at this, which says more about the state of terminal graphics than anything else. Somewhere, a sysadmin is using this to preview cat pictures over SSH and feeling very productive.

I learned about Chafa when I found a video editor that runs in the command line with keyboard control - vic - it just lets you insert split markers

I use chafa extensively, and it really is the best tool for terminal graphics... I use it as a fallback option for terminals without proper terminal graphics support

*** TLDR
［From title + comments, article behind paywall］ New research suggests that cosmic rays from nearby supernovas played a crucial role in forming Earth-like planets by helping create heavier elements. The standard model has stars producing elements up to iron, with supernovas scattering those elements and creating heavier ones through their explosions.

*** Take
Every atom heavier than iron in your body was forged in stellar explosions. Your gold wedding ring is supernova debris. Your phone's rare earth elements are cosmic violence crystallized. And yet people complain about their commute.

Why is it said that it takes a supernova to make elements heavier than iron? You're not going to get iron-iron fusion, but what about proton-iron fusion?

The Universe coalesced into hydrogen and helium from a quark-gluon plasma soon after the Big Bang. It's kind of staggering the sequence of events that occurred afterwards to bring us here
