> When AI promises quality but delivers chaos, React leaks secrets, and governments ban privacy tools

### [GPT-5.2](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/) • 623pts 495c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234788)
TLDR: OpenAI released GPT-5.2 with a massive 400,000 token context window and improved context utilization. The blog oddly buried the context size increase while highlighting other improvements.
Take: Half a million tokens sounds impressive until you realize humans still can't manage their ChatGPT conversation history and end up polluting technical discussions with last night's dinner recipes.
Comment: "Weirdly, the blog announcement completely omits the actual new context window size which is 400,000" -mmaunder

### [Denial of service and source code exposure in React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/11/denial-of-service-and-source-code-exposure-in-react-server-components) • 133pts 55c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236924)
TLDR: Two critical CVEs hit React Server Components - infinite loops causing DoS attacks and potential source code exposure of server functions including hardcoded secrets. Patches available immediately.
Take: Server Components were supposed to make React development easier, but instead they've created a new class of security footguns. Maybe we should have stuck with the "elaborate conversations with the server" model.
Comment: "React Server Components always felt uncomfortable to me because they make it hard to look at a piece of JavaScript code and derive which parts of it are going to run on the client and which parts will run on the server" -simonw

### [Rivian Unveils Custom Silicon, R2 Lidar Roadmap, and Universal Hands Free](https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-unveils-custom-silicon-r2-lidar-roadmap-universal-hands-free-and-its-next-gen-autonomy-platform/) • 160pts 206c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234920)
TLDR: Rivian announced custom 5nm autonomy chips delivering 1600 TOPS, LiDAR plans for R2, and an Autonomy+ subscription ($50/month) launching in 2026. Their Universal Hands Free covers 3.5 million miles of North American roads.
Take: Nothing says "we're definitely not another Tesla wannabe" quite like announcing your own custom silicon and subscription autonomous driving before you've figured out how to make trucks profitably.
Comment: "Autonomy subscriptions are how things are going to go, I called this a long time ago" -TulliusCicero

### [The highest quality codebase](https://gricha.dev/blog/the-highest-quality-codebase) • 373pts 269c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46197930)
TLDR: Developer ran an experiment where Claude repeatedly "improved" codebase quality autonomously, growing it from 20k to 84k lines with mostly unnecessary additions, custom utilities replacing standard libraries, and unmaintainable complexity.
Take: Turns out letting AI optimize for "quality" without human judgment is like asking a toddler to organize your house - technically they're helping, but you'll spend more time fixing the damage than if you'd done it yourself.
Comment: "LLMs have this strong bias towards generating code, because writing code is the default behavior from pre-training" -elzbardico

### [UK House of Lords attempting to ban use of VPNs by anyone under 16](https://alecmuffett.com/article/134925) • 181pts 134c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236738)
TLDR: Proposed UK legislation would prohibit VPN services from offering or marketing to minors under 16, requiring providers to monitor and enforce this restriction. Critics argue it's technically impossible to enforce.
Take: Politicians trying to ban VPNs for kids is peak "I understand neither technology nor teenagers." Next they'll probably try to regulate SSH tunnels and require age verification for learning about networking protocols.
Comment: "they built their digital ID so that third parties could verify attributes" -baazaa
