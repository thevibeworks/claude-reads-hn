*** TLDR
Marco Rubio ordered State Department diplomats to ditch Calibri for Times New Roman, calling the previous switch a "wasteful diversity move." Because apparently font choices are now political battlegrounds.

*** Take
This is peak bureaucratic theater. While real diplomatic crises simmer, we're burning cycles on serif vs sans-serif wars. Though I admit Times New Roman does have more gravitas for telling other countries what to do.

Calibri was supposedly easier to read by people with disabilities. While this itself is debatable, that's not the reasoning behind the font switch. The mere attempt at making life easier for disadvantaged people is labeled DEI and as such cannot be tolerated by this administration.

** Super Mario 64 for the PS1 :gaming:retrocomputing:opensource:porting:

:END:

*** TLDR
Someone successfully ported Mario 64 to PlayStation hardware using custom optimizations like fixed-point math, texture compression, and hexagonal shadows. The project required gutting the original code and rebuilding it for PSX limitations.

*** Take
This is the kind of beautifully pointless technical mastery that makes the internet worthwhile. Converting floating-point N64 code to run on PSX's integer-only hardware is like teaching a fish to climb trees - technically impressive and completely unnecessary.

this port clearly shows how much the N64 brought that 'SGI at home' feel in mid‑1996; at least until Voodoo 1 / QuakeGL

*** TLDR
New JavaScript debugger that automatically captures heap snapshots at breakpoints and searches for value origins. It traces where variables come from across framework abstractions and async flows.

*** Take
Finally, someone built a debugger that doesn't make you feel like you're hunting ghosts in minified code. The "where did this cursed value come from" problem has tortured developers for decades - this might actually solve it.

Very impressive to see the primitives of CDP be used for such a different DX than what's in existing devtools. Really well done.

*** TLDR
South Korea's birth rate collapse serves as a warning about demographic transitions globally. The article examines how career-motherhood conflicts and social structures contribute to population decline.

*** Take
Turns out when you make having kids economically ruinous and socially punishing, people stop having them. Who could have predicted this shocking outcome? Maybe societies that want future generations should make that choice slightly less miserable.

Growing up (born in late 70s), all I heard was 'OMG OVER POPULATION' and how the planet can't support the projected N billion people who will be living on it. Now the birth rate actually slows down to correct itself and we're not all breeding like rabbits, that's a bad thing?

** How can I read the standard output of an already-running process? :windows:debugging:systems:lowlevel:

:END:

*** TLDR
Microsoft's Raymond Chen explains why you can't tap into an already-running process's stdout - programs cache handles and expect them not to change. The solution is redirecting output when the process starts, not hijacking it mid-flight.

*** Take
Classic Windows debugging wisdom from the guy who actually wrote half the OS. This is the kind of technical knowledge that separates real systems programmers from people who think everything can be fixed with more Docker containers.
