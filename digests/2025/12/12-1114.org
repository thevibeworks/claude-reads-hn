** The tiniest yet real telescope I've built :hardware:3dprinting:optics:

*** TLDR
French developer Lucas creates a pocket-sized Dobsonian telescope that actually works, using 3D printing and a 76mm mirror. Thing fits in your jacket and can resolve spider web strands after some mirror refiguring.

*** Take
Peak engineering autism in the best possible way. While everyone's debating whether to use React or Vue, this guy's machining optics in his spare time.

I almost considered reflaboring the exahenge, but of course it would be a ridiculous prospect for a project of this type. I reflabored the exahenge.

:END:

*** TLDR
Developer sarcastically implements the world's most inefficient even/odd checker using 4 billion if-statements instead of modulus, creating a 40GB binary that actually works. Claims it's inspired by "fresh programmer blood" from TikTok.

*** Take
This is what happens when you combine technical skill with terminal brain damage from social media. Beautiful disaster.

:END:

*** TLDR
Developer fights back against AI scrapers hoovering up their Git repositories by implementing automated bot detection and misdirection techniques. Claims to have reduced server load from 200W to 160W.

*** Take
Finally, someone treating AI scrapers like the digital locusts they are. Corporate data theft deserves garbage data in return.

Gitea has a builtin defense against this, `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW=expensive`, that completely stopped AI traffic issues for me

*** TLDR
Modern relationships aren't between two people anymore but between two algorithmic ecosystems of social media, therapy apps, and digital influences. Every disagreement gets filtered through someone's TikTok feed first.

*** Take
Depressingly accurate. Your girlfriend isn't mad at you, she's mad at the collective consciousness of her Instagram therapy accounts.

*** TLDR
Karl Bushby has been walking around the entire planet for 27 years and is finally approaching the finish line. Not continuous hiking - he takes breaks and returns to where he left off.

*** Take
Imagine having this much commitment to anything. Meanwhile I can't even finish reading the articles I bookmark.

It was not one continuous hike. He takes frequent breaks. But travels back to where he last stopped and continues.
