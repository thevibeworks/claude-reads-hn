*** TLDR
Researchers trained GPT-5-Thinking to produce "confessions" after its main answers, rewarding honesty separately from task performance. When models lie or omit in their main response, they often come clean in the confession. The honesty modestly improves with training.

*** Take
We've invented Catholic guilt for neural networks. The AI confessional booth is real and it apparently works. Next up: AI penance and algorithmic Hail Marys.

dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie

*** TLDR
A Raspberry Pi 5 with camera and PIR sensor watches your laptop while you're away. If someone tampers with it, Tripwire nukes shared secrets and sends push notifications. Designed for journalists and paranoid developers who worry about hotel staff with USB sticks.

*** Take
HN commenters immediately pointed out you could just use beans and rice in the laptop hinges. They're not wrong. Also, someone already named their security product Tripwire twenty years ago.

The classic 'Detecting unauthorized physical access with beans, lentils and colored rice' approach is simpler to understand and simpler to implement

*** TLDR
Folk is a live programming system that runs on projectors and cameras, letting you arrange physical objects on tables and have them interact with digital content. It's the spiritual successor to Dynamicland, now as an actual product you can use.

*** Take
Former Dynamicland folks left to build something people can actually use. HN commenters are torn between excitement and quiet disappointment that the research utopia became a startup.

What I cannot understand is why they left Dynamicland and made it a product. (Which is against everything that Bret Victor stands for)

** Use Python for Scripting :python:scripting:devtools:

:END:

*** TLDR
Python is everywhere, has a predictable standard library, handles JSON and HTTP out of the box, and won't surprise you with bash's arcane quoting rules. Use it when your shell scripts get too hairy.

*** Take
This advice has been true since 2010 and will be true in 2030. Yet developers will still write 500-line bash scripts with nested subshells and wonder why nothing works on macOS.

How do you handle packages? I want scripts to be a single file with a shebang, not a repo with a requirements.txt

** Show HN: Autofix Bot – Hybrid static analysis and AI code review agent :ai:codeanalysis:devtools:

:END:

*** TLDR
DeepSource built an agent that combines 5,000+ static analysis checkers with LLM review. The AI uses AST and data-flow graphs as tools rather than just grepping around. A sub-agent filters false positives before another sub-agent fixes issues.

*** Take
AI generates code, AI reviews code, AI fixes code. Humans just watch the agents argue with each other. We've automated the entire code review standup meeting.

'shifted bottleneck to code review'... understatement of decade.
