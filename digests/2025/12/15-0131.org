* Vibe
The AI infrastructure wobbles while devs debate whether TypeScript is too much or not enough

* Highlights
- Anthropic outage: The machines briefly stopped thinking, status page actually worked
- JSDoc vs TypeScript: The holy war nobody asked for gets new ammunition
- Shai-Hulud attack: npm install continues its reign of terror
- Ask HN December: Everyone's building AI wrappers and simplifying their digital lives
- Hashcards: Someone finally made flashcards for people who think Anki is bloated

* Stories

** Anthropic Outage for Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4/4.5 across all services :ai:outage:infrastructure:anthropic:

*** TLDR
Anthropic's Claude models went down across all services. The incident was mitigated by 22:43 UTC. Their status page actually updated in real-time, which apparently is newsworthy because most companies treat status pages as historical fiction.

*** Take
Props to them for quick response, but the comments imagining a steampunk dystopia where LLM downtime crashes the global economy hit a little too close to the probable future. We're building civilization on API calls.

I'm imagining a steampunk dystopia in 50 years: 'all world production stopped, LLM hosting went down. The market is in free-fall. Sam, are you there?'

*** TLDR
The article argues that JSDoc with TypeScript checking gives you type safety without a build step. You write JavaScript with JSDoc annotations, TypeScript validates them, and you ship native JS. Best of both worlds for those allergic to transpilation.

*** Take
The comments are peak HN. One person sharing career wisdom about types being "written in your head" and that's "very volatile." Another lamenting how the community chose native TS over Closure Compiler. The real takeaway is that every JS project eventually reinvents the same type safety wheel, just with different shaped spokes.

The types exist whether you write them down or not. If they're not written down, they're written down in your head. Your head is very volatile.

** Shai-Hulud compromised a dev machine and raided GitHub org access: a post-mortem :security:npm:supplychain:javascript:

:END:

*** TLDR
Trigger.dev got hit by a supply chain attack through a compromised npm package. An attacker named Shai-Hulud (yes, the Dune sandworm) used npm post-install scripts to compromise a developer's machine, then accessed GitHub org credentials and AWS secrets. They're calling for blocking post-install scripts by default.

*** Take
The author's defense of "running npm install is not negligence" got properly roasted. When your package manager allows arbitrary code execution on install, trusting the entire npm ecosystem IS the negligence. The pnpm maintainer quote about blocking post-install scripts being painful but necessary has aged like fine wine.

No, your security failure is that you use a package manager that allows third-parties push arbitrary code into your product with no oversight.

*** TLDR
The monthly "show your toys" thread. Themes this month: lots of digital decluttering (deleting accounts, canceling VPSs, going USB-C only), people building secure enclave tooling, and a suspicious number of translation bots.

*** Take
The most upvoted comment is someone simplifying their digital life and downgrading their home to a "dumb living" setup. In a thread about what people are building, the winner is someone who is actively un-building. Peak 2025 energy.

Simplification of my digital self. Removed most of my online accounts. Removed all my VPS's. Removed most apps from my phone except core ones.

** Hashcards: A plain-text spaced repetition system :learning:cli:tools:productivity:

*** TLDR
Hashcards is a CLI flashcard system where cards are identified by content hashes. Uses FSRS algorithm (the new hotness over SM-2), stores everything in plain text, and lets you edit cards in any text editor. Aimed at people who find Anki too heavy.

*** Take
Someone in the comments using spaced repetition for behavior modification with their wife's dentist situation is the most HN thing I've read today. Also, the fair criticism that content hashing means editing a card resets your progress. The eternal tradeoff between simplicity and functionality.

I think that the real power of spaced repetition is not in flashcard applications like this. It is in behavior modification.
