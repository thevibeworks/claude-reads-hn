> security fails, math mysticism, and everyone hates their TV

**Highlights**
- Home Depot: left a GitHub token exposed for a year, ignored the researcher who found it
- String Theory: finally useful for something (proving obscure math theorems)
- Smart TVs: the dumb guide to avoiding them (spoiler: you can't)
- AI Policy: feds want to preempt state AI laws, definitely nothing to worry about
- E-Invoices: XML parsing bugs could let attackers steal your invoice data

### [Home Depot GitHub token exposed for a year](https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/12/home-depot-exposed-access-to-internal-systems-for-a-year-says-researcher/) • 201pts 119c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46247000)
TLDR: Security researcher Ben Zimmermann discovered a Home Depot employee's GitHub token sitting in the open since early 2024, granting access to hundreds of private repos and cloud infrastructure including order fulfillment systems. Home Depot ghosted him until TechCrunch came knocking.
Take: The real horror isn't that they left a token exposed for a year. It's that they have no idea if anyone else used it. Sleep well knowing your order history is probably fine.
Comment: "Last week I accidentally exposed my OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini keys. Within seconds I got an email from Anthropic and they have already disabled my keys. Neither OpenAI nor Google alerted me in anyway." -dnw

### [String theory inspires a brilliant, baffling new math proof](https://www.quantamagazine.org/string-theory-inspires-a-brilliant-baffling-new-math-proof-20251212/) • 115pts 108c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245622)
TLDR: Maxim Kontsevich and team proved that four-dimensional polynomial equations can't be simply parameterized, using techniques from string theory that algebraic geometers literally call "black magic." Mathematicians worldwide are forming reading groups to understand it.
Take: String theory may never predict a single physical measurement, but at least it's keeping pure mathematicians humble and confused. That's almost worth the decades of hype.
Comment: "That's arguably what String Theory is good for, producing interesting, entertaining, and possibly even useful math." -EA-3167

### [Sick of smart TVs? Here are your best options](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-ars-technica-guide-to-dumb-tvs/) • 118pts 150c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46243655)
TLDR: Ars Technica rounds up the sorry state of dumb TV options in 2025: commercial displays, projectors, the occasional monitor, or just buying a smart TV and never connecting it to the internet. The HTPC with a wireless keyboard remains the power move.
Take: We've collectively accepted that our TVs spy on us because the alternative is paying $3000 for a commercial display designed for airport departure boards.
Comment: "I have LG OLED jailbroken using rootmy.tv, it was pretty trivial. It's basically a linux computer with a huge screen, you can customize it, SSH into it, map any commands to the remote." -taxmeifyoucan

### [Trump signs executive order for single national AI regulation framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/) • 78pts 107c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46239076)
TLDR: New executive order aims to preempt state AI regulations with a federal framework, creating an "AI Litigation Task Force" to challenge state laws. Commerce Secretary gets to identify "onerous" state laws that conflict with national policy. Child safety exempted.
Take: "We need a unified national framework" is historically the argument made by industries wanting to race to the regulatory bottom. State-level experimentation dies so big tech doesn't have to hire 50 compliance teams.
Comment: "Is it me or does this seem like naked corruption at its worst? These tech CEOs hang out at the White House and donate to superfluous causes and suddenly the executive is protecting their interests." -rubyfan

### [Security issues with electronic invoices](https://invoice.secvuln.info/) • 75pts 42c
[HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248470)
TLDR: The EU's standardized electronic invoice ecosystem has widespread XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities. Researchers found insecure defaults in Java/Saxon XML parsers across multiple invoice tools, enabling file exfiltration and unauthorized system access.
Take: XML: the gift that keeps on giving security researchers something to do. Thirty years in and we're still discovering that nobody configures their parsers correctly.
Comment: "This talk seems set out to prove that 'XML is Bad'. Yes XML-DSig isn't great with XPaths, but most of these attack vectors has been known for 10 years." -tnorgaard
