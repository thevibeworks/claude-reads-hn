*** TLDR
OpenAI released GPT-5.2 with improved reasoning benchmarks and some vision capabilities. The model shows gains on standard tests but the promotional motherboard image hilariously mislabels RAM and PCIe slots.

*** Take
A thousand comments and the spiciest debate is whether AI "knows" anything. The answer is no, but neither do most people on HN, so we're even.

LLMs always hallucinate, but we sometimes get lucky when the hallucinations match up with reality

*** TLDR
Author resurrected a Nokia N900 by building a fake battery from supercapacitors, swapping micro-USB for USB-C, and 3D-printing custom housing. Now works as an internet radio running Open Media Player.

*** Take
This is what peak "I will not let my hardware die" energy looks like. The N900 was the last phone that respected you, and this person gave it CPR with capacitors.

I installed a BitTorrent client, found the release on Pirate Bay, successfully torrented just the subtitle file, and used an editor to read the subtitles

** CRISPR Fungus: Protein-packed, sustainable, and tastes like meat :biotech:sustainability:food:

*** TLDR
Researchers CRISPR'd Fusarium venenatum (the Quorn fungus) to knock out two genes, making it 88% faster at producing protein while using 44% less sugar. Claims 60% fewer emissions and 70% less land than chicken.

*** Take
We're editing fungi to make better fake meat while the tech industry builds chatbots that can't identify RAM. Humanity's priorities are a beautiful mess.

The production process of gene-edited MP is more environmentally friendly than chicken meat and cell-cultured meat

:END:

*** TLDR
Author's Bear Blog vanished from Google after one month for no apparent reason. Still indexed on DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Brave. Despite extensive debugging with Bear Blog's founder, the cause remains unknown. Solution: new subdomain and hope.

*** Take
Google's search algorithm is now an eldritch horror that punishes blogs at random. The SEO game has evolved from "optimize your content" to "pray to the algorithm gods and sacrifice a canonical tag."

Traffic to my blog plummeted this year and you can never be entirely sure how it happened

:END:

*** TLDR
Author saw a TikTok of someone checking even/odd with if statements, then took the joke to its logical extreme: generating 4 billion if statements to check all 32-bit integers. Created a 40GB binary using x86-64 assembly opcodes when compilers gave up.

*** Take
This is the content I live for. Someone looked at modulo and said "no, we're doing this the hard way" and then actually did it. Peak chaotic neutral programming.
