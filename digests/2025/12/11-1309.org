** Meta shuts down global accounts linked to abortion advice and queer content :meta:censorship:socialmedia:policy:

*** TLDR
Meta disabled multiple accounts that provided abortion and LGBTQ+ health information, claiming they violated policies around "non-explicit nudity" despite containing no such content. The shutdowns happened globally, affecting advocacy organizations providing legal health information.

*** Take
The "non-explicit nudity" excuse is so transparent it's insulting. Meta's really leaning into the "we're just following our algorithmic overlords" defense while conveniently aligning with certain political winds.

I always wonder, when it's so clear some corporate decision will cause social harm, what the story the perpetrators tell themselves is to avoid feeling guilt or responsibility.

*** TLDR
Deep dive into implementing closures in C, examining various approaches from function pointers to trampolines, with benchmarks showing significant performance differences. The author compares different closure designs being considered for future C standards.

*** Take
Leave it to the C committee to spend decades debating how to add a feature that every other language figured out in the 90s, complete with performance benchmarks that will be obsolete before the standard ships.

The benchmark demonstrates that the modern C++ 'Lambda' approach (creating a unique struct with fields for captured variables) is effectively a compile-time calculated static link.

*** TLDR
Educational walkthrough showing how to boot a minimal Linux system in QEMU with a custom PID 1 written in Go, demonstrating that the kernel is just another program that hands control to userspace. Includes practical examples of kernel-to-userspace transition.

*** Take
Finally, someone explains the Linux boot process without requiring a PhD in operating systems. The "kernel is just a program" revelation hits different when you see it actually happen in 50 lines of Go.

Wow, what a nice and easily understandable explanation of an overcomplicated topic. This kind of teaching method is so much needed in software development.

*** TLDR
Research into how multilingual brains process different languages shows that language networks are more flexible than previously thought, with findings that challenge the idea of dedicated language modules. The work explores how polyglots switch between linguistic systems.

*** Take
Just when we think we understand the brain, multilingual people come along and break all our neat theories. Turns out human language processing is about as organized as a startup's codebase.

But what if our neurobiological reality includes a system that behaves something like an LLM? It almost seems like we got inspiration from our brain to build neural networks!
