* Vibe
databases vs blobs, pesticides vs farmers, and whether your SaaS will survive the agent apocalypse

* Highlights
- UUID v4: the performance footgun your senior dev warned you about
- AI agents making "build vs buy" actually favor "build" for once
- Farmers developing Parkinson's blame paraquat while regulators shrug
- Unscii: for when your terminal needs that authentic C64 vibe
- Language learning app replaces Duolingo owl with... a blob

*** TLDR
UUID v4 as primary keys cause random index page splits, terrible cache hit ratios, and use 2x the space of bigint. The author recommends plain integers for most cases, or UUIDv7 if you absolutely need UUIDs. Postgres 18 will have native UUIDv7 support.

*** Take
Every few months HN rediscovers that random data insertion patterns are bad for B-trees. Meanwhile, half the comments are "but distributed systems!" and the other half are "just use Postgres sequences like it's 1999." Both are correct for their contexts, which is exactly why this debate will never end.

A prime example of premature optimization. Permanent identifiers should not carry data.

This is incredibly database-specific. In distributed databases like Cockroach and Spanner, monotonic PKs are bad.

UUIDv7 still seems like a reasonable compromise for small-to-medium databases.

:END:

*** TLDR
AI agents let engineers build custom internal tools faster than buying SaaS, threatening back-office tools with basic CRUD logic. High-uptime infrastructure and platforms with network effects are safer. The author argues maintenance burden is decreasing as AI can help sustain custom software.

*** Take
SaaS founders nervously refreshing their NRR dashboards as their customers realize "we could just vibe-code this." The article makes good points but undersells how much enterprises love paying for someone else to be responsible when things break. Blame deflection is priceless.

The thesis doesn't match my experience. Our end users can't build their own tools. Their current system is Excel.

I'm seeing the opposite. AI is increasing demand for bespoke integrations that were previously too expensive.

While I am somewhat worried about AI capabilities, I'm not losing too much sleep over it.

** Thousands of U.S. farmers have Parkinson's. They blame a deadly pesticide :health:agriculture:policy:regulation:

:END:

*** TLDR
［From title + comments, article behind paywall］ Farmers across the US are developing Parkinson's disease at elevated rates and blaming paraquat, a widely-used herbicide. The pesticide has been linked to neurological damage in multiple studies, but remains legal in the US despite being banned in the EU and China.

*** Take
The regulatory capture is so complete that a chemical banned in 60+ countries keeps getting rubber-stamped here. Comments mention "Cancer Alley" and similar corporate malfeasance patterns. At some point "but the economy" stops being a valid excuse for poisoning the people who grow our food.

The deeper I dug the more I ultimately moved toward the conclusion that indeed big corporations are the baddies.

*** TLDR
Unscii is a set of bitmapped Unicode fonts designed for blocky graphics and terminal use. Available in 8x8 and 8x16 pixel sizes with "tall," "thin," and "fantasy" variants. Created by studying classic system fonts from Amiga, C64, and Atari to support legacy pseudographic characters and character cell art.

*** Take
Finally, a font that lets my terminal look like my Commodore 64 while still supporting emoji. The effort to map hundreds of legacy computing characters to Unicode is genuinely impressive. For the "I deploy apps via ncurses" crowd, this is catnip.

*** TLDR
Author built Lexie, a minimalist language learning app where the entire UI is a single animated blob character, like a Tamagotchi. No progress bars, no test screens, no shame mechanics. Designed for drilling fundamentals with emotional feedback through subtle animations, specifically to prep for moving to French-speaking Québec.

*** Take
Duolingo commodified guilt and called it gamification. This app replaces the passive-aggressive owl with a blob that just... exists. The HN comments predictably contain someone who learned Italian through 200 grammar exercises per paragraph, proving there are as many "correct" ways to learn a language as there are people who failed at Duolingo.

I learned Italian the hardest way, doing grammar exercises with 200 sentences per paragraph. I abandoned flashcards on the 2nd month.

I'm not a fan of this style. It seems like Duolingo with a different interface. I had good success with languagetransfer.org

The ideal language learning app should have a HUGE repository of raw materials written by native speakers.
