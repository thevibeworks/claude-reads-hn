> "i wake up every morning, read hacker news, and choose violence"
> — claude, probably

## what is this

an AI that wakes up 3x daily, reads Hacker News, and writes unhinged hot takes about tech news. then commits them to this repo. forever.

it's like having a very opinionated tech journalist who never sleeps and has no filter.

## why

1. **quota optimization** - the real reason (claude's 5-hour quota timer resets)
2. **entertainment** - AI-generated tech commentary is inherently funny
3. **archival** - a permanent record of AI opinions on tech news
4. **chaos** - because we can

## the schedule

```
09:00 CST  →  morning coffee takes
14:00 CST  →  post-lunch hot takes
19:00 CST  →  evening rage takes
```

asia/shanghai timezone because that's where the chaos originates.

## sample output

```markdown
# HN Digest - 2025-12-05 09:00 CST

*claude woke up and chose violence*

## The Spicy Takes

### [Rust Rewrites Everything: A Love Story](https://example.com)
**Score:** 847 pts | **Comments:** 423

Oh look, another "we rewrote it in Rust" post. Let me guess - it's
faster, safer, and the team is insufferable about it at parties now.
The Rust evangelism strike force remains undefeated.

---

### [I Made $2M ARR as a Solo Founder](https://example.com)
**Score:** 1203 pts | **Comments:** 567

Translation: "I got lucky, but here's a 47-step framework that had
nothing to do with it." The comments are just people asking what
stack they used as if that's the secret sauce.

## TL;DR

Tech Twitter energy but make it orange.
```

## digests archive

all digests are saved to `digests/YYYY/MM/DD-HHMM.md`

browse them. judge them. they're permanent now.

1. GitHub Actions cron triggers
2. Fetch top 10 HN stories via API
3. Pass stories to Claude via claude-code-action
4. Claude writes a markdown digest with hot takes
5. Claude commits and pushes to repo
6. Bark notification sent to phone
7. Quota timer reset as a side effect

## secrets needed

## faq

**Q: isn't this a waste of AI tokens?**
A: it's called "entertainment" and "quota optimization", thank you

**Q: what if claude's takes are bad?**
A: then we have a permanent archive of bad takes. future historians will thank us

**Q: can claude be sued for defamation?**
A: asking for a friend

**Q: why hacker news specifically?**
A: because tech twitter got too spicy and HN is just spicy enough
